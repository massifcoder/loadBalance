# C Socket Load Balancer

Welcome to our C Socket Load Balancer repository! This project implements a simple load balancer using sockets and multithreading concepts in C.

## Overview

Our load balancer is designed to distribute incoming network requests across multiple backend servers to ensure efficient resource utilization and optimal performance.

## Key Features

- **Socket Communication**: Utilizes socket programming in C to establish communication channels between the load balancer and backend servers, as well as between the load balancer and clients.
- **Multithreading**: Implements multithreading to handle multiple client connections concurrently, enabling the load balancer to efficiently manage incoming requests.
- **Dynamic Load Distribution**: Distributes incoming requests among backend servers based on predefined load balancing algorithms, such as round-robin, least connections, or weighted distribution.
- **Health Checking**: Periodically checks the health and availability of backend servers to ensure that only healthy servers receive traffic.
- **Scalability**: Supports scalability by allowing additional backend servers to be added to the pool dynamically, enabling horizontal scaling as demand increases.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Provides fault tolerance by detecting and routing traffic away from failed or overloaded servers to healthy ones, ensuring high availability and reliability.

## Technologies Used

Our load balancer is implemented in C and utilizes the following technologies:

- **Socket Programming**: Utilizes the socket API for communication between the load balancer, backend servers, and clients.
- **Multithreading**: Implements multithreading using pthreads to handle multiple client connections concurrently.
- **C Standard Library**: Utilizes standard C libraries for various functionalities such as string manipulation, memory management, and error handling.

## Getting Started

To get started with our C Socket Load Balancer, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.

2. **Compile the Code**: Compile the load balancer code using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).


3. **Configure Backend Servers**: Update the load balancer configuration file to specify the IP addresses and ports of backend servers.

4. **Run the Load Balancer**: Start the load balancer executable and verify that it is running correctly.

## Usage

Provide instructions for using the load balancer, including how to configure backend servers, start the load balancer, and connect clients.
